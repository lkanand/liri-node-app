# LIRI Bot
<h3>About this Project:</h3>
LIRI Bot is a node-based application that allows users to pull the 20 most recent tweets / re-tweets from my Twitter account (@lokey_charms) as well as look up  information regarding their favorite songs and movies. All user commands and data pulls are logged in a text file titled "log.txt".
<br/>
This application incorporates a number of npm packages (fs, request, dotenv, node-spotify-api and twitter) and APIs provided by Twitter, Spotify and OMDB.
